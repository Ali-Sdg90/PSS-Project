## 🎯 How the Game Works

### Game Rules
The game follows classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** rules:
- 📄 **Paper** defeats 🪨 **Stone**
- 🪨 **Stone** defeats ✂️ **Scissor**
- ✂️ **Scissor** defeats 📄 **Paper**
- Same types don't fight each other

### Game Mechanics

1. **Initialization**: A configurable number of Paper, Scissor, and Stone entities spawn randomly on the canvas
2. **Movement**: Each entity moves with random velocity across the screen
3. **Collision Detection**: When entities come within a detection radius, they battle
4. **Battle Resolution**: The winning entity survives; the loser is eliminated
5. **Population Display**: Real-time score counter shows remaining entities

### Customization

Edit `src/constants/appConfig.js` to tweak game settings:

```javascript
export const appConfig = {
    numberOfStones: 50,        // Initial stone count
    numberOfPapers: 50,        // Initial paper count
    numberOfScissors: 50,      // Initial scissor count
    maxSpeed: 1,               // Maximum velocity
    minSpeed: -1,              // Minimum velocity
    gameSpeed: 30,             // Animation frame rate (ms)
    fixItemSize: 1.5,          // Entity size
    minItemSize: 1.5,          // Minimum boundary
    maxItemSize: 98.5,         // Maximum boundary
    detectionRadios: 3,        // Battle detection radius
};
```

## 🇮🇷 A Story Behind This Project

This project was created during the **complete internet blackout in Iran in October 2025**.

Building this game was an incredible challenge and rewarding experience:
- ❌ No internet access for research or documentation
- ❌ No AI assistance or external help
- ✅ Just an idea in my mind
- ✅ Pure passion for programming and creating

Every line of code was written from scratch, relying solely on my knowledge and problem-solving skills. It was a unique opportunity to prove that limitations can spark creativity, and the most satisfying projects are those built with determination and persistence.
